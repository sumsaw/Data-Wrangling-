# Udacity Project 4 : Wrangle a Data set 

My forth project of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The aim of this project was to apply the techniques learnt to wrangle a 
data set. We needed to analyses the tweets from page WeRateDogs. Udacity provided us with a dataset of about 5000 tweets of WeRateDogs page.
I just manually downloaded that data set . Additional information on this tweets such as retweet count and favorite count where obtained 
using the twitter API and the tweepy module. Another file was hosted by Udacity on its server and I needed to download it using **Requests**
library. This file basically had image shared on the twitter feed of WeRateDogs classified whether they where dogs or not and if yes which 
breed.<br>

I imported all the three dataset into my jupyter notebook shared here. I cleaned all the quality and tidiness issue which where present in 
the dataset and drew few conclusion from it.<br> 

In this repository I am also sharing the wrangle repot.pdf which shows some of my step I took to clean the dataset. act_report.pdf which 
shows the insights drawn from the dataset. 

Please feel free to go through the notebook for additional details.
